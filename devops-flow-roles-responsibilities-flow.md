#### **6. Applications Deployment Workflow Across Environments**

1. **Code Commit and Branching Strategy**:
   - Developers commit their code to individual branches (e.g., **feature**, **hotfix**, etc.), allowing for isolated development and testing.
   - Leveraging the **multi-branch pipeline (MBP)** setup in Jenkins, developers have the flexibility to deploy their application code to the environment of their choice, typically starting with the **development (dev) environment**.

2. **Development (Dev) Environment Deployment**:
   - Upon committing code, developers deploy the application to the **dev environment** to validate their changes.
   - The MBP configuration allows developers to select and deploy specific branches to the dev environment, facilitating rapid iteration and testing.
   - Once the application performs well in the dev environment, it progresses to the next stage.

3. **Testing (Test) Environment Deployment**:
   - The application is promoted from the dev environment to the **test environment** for comprehensive testing.
   - In this environment, the **SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test)** team performs:
     - **Functional Testing**
     - **Automation Testing**
     - **System and Regression Testing**
   - Any issues identified during testing are reported to developers for resolution. This process iterates as necessary until the application is stable in the test environment.

4. **Staging (Stage) Environment Deployment**:
   - Once the application passes all tests in the lower environments (dev and test), it is promoted to the **staging environment**.
   - To ensure stability and control, only branches with a **release naming convention** (e.g., `release/1.2.3`) are allowed to be deployed to the staging environment. This restriction is enforced in the Jenkins pipeline with conditional checks, allowing only **release branches** to trigger deployments in staging.
   - The **release branch** undergoes a full pipeline deployment in staging, where the complete application release is validated by the SDET team through end-to-end testing.

5. **Production (Prod) Environment Deployment**:
   - Once the code in staging is confirmed stable, the deployment process moves towards production.
   - Only **Git tags** are allowed for production deployments, as tags provide greater control and security over branch-based deployments. The Jenkins pipeline is explicitly configured to deploy only tags with a specific naming convention (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
   - To prepare for production, the DevOps team or the development lead creates a tag from the release branch following the naming convention.

6. **Go/No-Go Meeting**:
   - Prior to production deployment, a **Go/No-Go meeting** is conducted with all stakeholders, including:
     - Product Managers
     - Developers
     - QA/SDET team
     - DevOps team
   - In this meeting, all parties review the application status and address any final concerns. If everyone agrees on a “Go” decision, the release is approved for production.

7. **Production Deployment (Secondary and Primary Rollout)**:
   - On the scheduled production date, the DevOps team prepares a **list of microservices** to be deployed, based on the approved tag versions.
   - The Jenkins pipeline includes an **approval process**, configured so only authorized personnel (the DevOps team or development lead) can trigger the production deployment. This additional layer of control ensures that only validated code is released to production.
   - **Secondary Production Deployment**:
     - The approved tag for each microservice is deployed to the **secondary production environment** first.
     - The QA team conducts a final round of testing to confirm the application’s performance and stability in a live environment.
   - **Primary Production Deployment**:
     - Once testing in the secondary production environment is successful, the application is deployed to the **primary production environment**, making it live for all users.

8. **Rollback Procedures**:
   - In cases where a rollback is necessary, the use of **Git tags** provides a quick and reliable method.
   - By re-deploying a previous, stable tag directly, the DevOps team can revert to a known good state without code changes, minimizing downtime and ensuring a consistent rollback process.
   - This process is integrated into the Jenkins pipeline, allowing rapid deployment of the tagged version to production if any critical issues arise.

   - Implemented **Google Monitoring Suite** to monitor microservices and application infrastructure deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
   - Configured dashboards, alerts, and metrics to provide real-time visibility into application performance, resource usage, and overall health of services.

2. **Custom Metrics and Alerts**:
   - Defined custom metrics to track key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to each microservice, including response times, error rates, and request counts.
   - Set up automated alerts for critical thresholds to proactively notify the DevOps and SRE teams of potential issues, allowing for quick responses and reduced downtime.

3. **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Integrated monitoring with the CI/CD pipeline, enabling developers and stakeholders to access real-time insights about deployment impacts and service stability.
   - Used monitoring data to validate deployments in production and track performance over time, facilitating continuous improvement.

4. **Comprehensive Dashboards**:
   - Built dashboards in Google Monitoring Suite, providing visualizations of key metrics for quick assessment of system health.
   - Enabled access to these dashboards for DevOps, QA, and development teams, ensuring transparency and collaborative troubleshooting capabilities.
